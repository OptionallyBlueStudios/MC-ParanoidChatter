## PLEASE NOTE
When editing the code, edit it in MCreator ONLY since this project was made in it. To do this, open the https://github.com/OptionallyBlueStudios/MC-pchatt.jar/blob/main/Source/pchatt.mcreator in MCreator once you have all the files downloaded from the Source folder. You must download all of them into the same folders. I recommend downloading the ZIP file of the source code from the latest release then unzipping that, going to Source folder and opening pchatt.mcreator. NOT paranoidchatter.mcreator (the old one).
